# multidemo
A demoscene developed using C++ multithreading.

The objective of the project is to define a multithreaded system that is able to write on a common memory space (a texture) and see the result in real time.
Then, I would like to study the real improvements obtained by multithreading.
The framework used on screen is SDL3 becuase it is a graphics framework I didn't know, so I can learn it a bit

# How to run
In order to make the application work, you should just clone the project and run it inside Visual Studio
